# Define the question

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). 

# Metric for success

In order to work on the above problem, you need to do the following:

-   Define the question- the metric for success, the context,experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

-   Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

-   Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.

-   From your insights provide a conclusion and recommendation.

-   Build an associative model and visualize some of the rules

-   Create a plot of anomalies using the dataset provided. 


# Data Understanding (the context)

Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.
1. Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction
2. Part 2: Feature Selection
3. Part 3: Association Rules
4. Part 4: Anomaly Detection


In order to work on the above problem, you need to do the following:

-   Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

-   Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

-   Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.

-   From your insights provide a conclusion and recommendation.

-   Build the associative model and inspect the rules.

# Experimental design

1.  Import the data to R
2.  Perform data exploration
3.  Define metrics for success
4.  Perform Univariate and Bivariate data Analysis
5.  Build an associative model 
5.  Provide conclusion
